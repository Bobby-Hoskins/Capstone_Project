## Description

The collapsing hamburger menu takes place switching from desktop to both tablet and mobile view. On desktop view, the navigation menu is displayed as a row and in tablet and mobile view, it’s presented as a column. Hover effects are applied on desktop view. 

Throughout the webapp, the layout of the content is mostly utilizing flexbox. Flexbox was used to align both parent and child elements for mobile, tablet, and desktop view. Flexbox is a simple way of aligning the content and placing it where it needs to be on each page. 

The nth child pseudo-class is used in different ways on the webapp. It’s utilized in the mobile menu to transform the mobile hamburger menu. It’s also used to target even and odd buttons on the meditation page to assign the background of the button a color. The same was done on the quotes page. 
JavaScript variables were used throughout the webapp to help add functionality. The mobile menu and meditation app both used JavaScript varables.
